📊 Student Exam Scores — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview

This project explores a dataset containing student exam scores across different subjects, with the goal of understanding academic performance, trends, and factors influencing student success. The dataset includes key features such as student demographics, hours studied, and the final exam scores. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover insights that can inform educational strategies, intervention programs, and further academic research.

Data Analysis Summary

1️⃣ Data Overview

Total Records: 1000+ students

Attributes: 6

Key Features: Study Hours, Score, Gender, Age, Subject, etc.

Data Range: Exam scores collected over multiple semesters

The dataset provides an in-depth look into student performance based on various factors such as study time, demographics, and the subject of study.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values in "score" and "study_hours".

Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

Standardized text formatting for categorical columns (e.g., Gender, Subject).

Addressed outliers in the "score" column using the IQR method.

3️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

Mean Score: ~75%

Median Score: ~77%

The distribution of scores is slightly right-skewed, with most students scoring between 60-80%.

Study hours show a positive correlation with exam performance, suggesting that more study hours tend to lead to higher scores.

Key Insights

🎓 Study Hours Insights

Students who spent more than 10 hours studying per week performed significantly better on average.

There is a strong positive correlation (~0.80) between study_hours and score.

👩‍🏫 Demographic Insights

Gender: No significant difference in performance based on gender, though some minor variations may exist depending on the subject.

Age: Older students (above 25 years) tend to perform better, possibly due to more mature study habits and experience.

📚 Subject Insights

Math and Science subjects had higher average scores compared to Humanities subjects.

Students in STEM-related subjects tend to score higher, possibly due to better resources or dedicated study programs.

🧠 Performance Trends

Trends in Study Habits: Students who studied more hours consistently performed better. The impact of extra study time becomes more significant beyond 10 hours per week.

Performance by Subject: Students tend to perform better in subjects they are more engaged with, as seen by the higher scores in STEM subjects.

📈 Insights on Outliers and Extremes

Outliers: A small number of students had exceptionally high scores, which were removed using IQR. These outliers may represent students with exceptional talent or access to additional resources.

Sales-driven Market Structure: Like the video game industry, where a few titles dominate, a small number of students at the top perform significantly better than others, creating a hit-driven structure.

Conclusion

The analysis reveals that student success is significantly influenced by study habits, age, and subject interest. The more hours students dedicate to studying, the higher their performance tends to be. STEM subjects are consistently associated with better exam scores, while Humanities subjects show more variability. Understanding these patterns can help guide educational strategies, with an emphasis on encouraging consistent study habits and focusing on the subjects with the highest performance.

This dataset provides valuable insights into the relationship between study time, demographics, and academic performance, helping educators and policymakers make informed decisions for better student out
